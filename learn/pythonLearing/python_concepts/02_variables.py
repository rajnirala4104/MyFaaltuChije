"""
A variable is like a label or container that stores data. You give it a name, and it holds a value in memory and we can access the data by calling its name.
In Python, you donâ€™t need to declare the type. Just assign a value and Python figures out the type for you.

# e.g
var1 = 10  # this is a vaiable with name var1
print(var1)  # ouput - 10
print(type(var1))  # <class 'int'>
